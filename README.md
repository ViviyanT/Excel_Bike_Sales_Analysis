- User-friendly features and interactive elements may be included to enhance the dashboard's usability.

## Key Findings

- **Income Matters**: Customers who bought bikes tend to have higher incomes.

- **Age and Preferences**: The 31-40 age group makes the most bike purchases.

- **Commute and Transport**: Customers with shorter commutes (0-1 miles) buy the most bikes, while those with long commutes (over 10 miles) prefer cars.

- **Car Ownership**: People with no car or 1-2 cars purchase more bikes than those with 3-4 cars.

- **Family Size Impact**: Larger families buy fewer bikes, likely prioritizing cars for practicality.

These key findings summarize the main insights from the analysis.
